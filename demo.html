    // When a user taps a quote in your index file and navigates to the blog page,
    // you need to pass the book's name (or ID) to this blog page.
    // The most common ways are:
    // 1. Using URL parameters (e.g., blog.html?book=The-Art-of-War)
    // 2. Using localStorage or sessionStorage

    // For this example, let's assume we're getting the book name from a URL parameter.
    // Example URL: yourblogpage.html?bookName=The-Art-of-War
    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
